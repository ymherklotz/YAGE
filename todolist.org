* General

** TODO Add comments

*** Reason
    Currently there are no comments in the code. They should be added so that in the future the code
    can be edited easily and improved without having to know the exact implementation of every function.

*** Requirements
    - It should follow the doxygen API so that documentation can easily be generated.
    

* Graphics

** TODO Switch GPU API

*** Reason
    Vulkan is much more straight forward and it should be easier to understand OpenGL from it. I
    also the newest API that will be used in the newest games and is supported by quite a few
    graphics cards.

*** Requirements
    - yage shouldn't depend on GL anymore and exclusively use Vulkan libraries.
